        <p class="title">Pan-Seared Steak</p>

        <p class="description">
            This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic butter that makes it taste like a steakhouse quality meal.
            You'll be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak that's seared on the outside,
            and perfectly tender inside.
